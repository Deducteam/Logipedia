  A query expression to filter the list of collections.

  You can specify a query expression for collection fields (e.g. ``name``,
  ``options``).

  For server versions < 3.0, the filter can only be used to match the ``name``
  field with a string value. More complex filters will result in an exception at
  execution time if used.
