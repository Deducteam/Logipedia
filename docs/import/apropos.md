title: Importing proofs into Logipedia
---
Importing proofs in Logipedia boils down to translating proofs into Dedukti.
Currently, this is possible for:

- Matita via [Krajono](https://github.com/Deducteam/matita)
- OpenTheory and HolLight via [Holide](https://github.com/Deducteam/Holide)
- Coq with [CoqInE](https://github.com/Deducteam/coqine).
