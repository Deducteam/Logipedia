# Concept alignment
We don't do any concept alignement: every proofs comme in an axiomatized way.
You need then to align the concepts of the library from Logipedia to the ones
of your system. But if you are interested to try do something, send us an
email.

OpenTheory output comsumes a lot of memory (about 4Go). This is due to a
memoization problem on our side. We hope to fix this in a future version.
